## 📨 How to Use the Templates

After extracting, you can use the email templates for your volunteer surveys.

### Open the Email Templates

Templates usually come in `.html` files. You can:

- Open them in any web browser to preview how the email will look  
- Open in a plain text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit) to see the source code  
- Open in an email client or marketing tool to customize and send them  

### Sending the Emails

You can send these templates in two main ways:

#### 1. Using Your Email Program

- Open your email program (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)  
- Compose a new email  
- Copy the full contents of the `.html` file and paste it into the email body (make sure your email supports HTML formatting)  
- Add your volunteers’ email addresses in the recipients field  
- Customize any text if needed, like the volunteer’s name or date  
- Send the email  

This manual method is simple and works well for small groups.

#### 2. Using Email Marketing Services

If your organization uses platforms like Mailchimp, Constant Contact, or Laravel’s mail system, you can:

- Upload the `.html` template to the service  
- Customize and manage your volunteer list  
- Schedule or send the email campaign directly from the tool  

This method works best when you send emails to many volunteers regularly.

## 🔧 Customize the Templates

- Open the `.html` file in a text editor or specialized email editor  
- Change colors, fonts, or logos by editing the corresponding sections  
- Edit the text to fit your survey questions or details  
- Save the changes and test by sending a copy to yourself  

If you are unsure how to edit HTML, consider asking for help from someone with basic web skills.
